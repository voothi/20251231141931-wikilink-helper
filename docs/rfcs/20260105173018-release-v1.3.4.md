# Release v1.3.4 - Chrome Web Store & Privacy

## Summary
Release v1.3.4 marks the official publication of the Wikilink Helper to the Chrome Web Store. It focuses on making the extension more accessible and providing clear guidance on user privacy and permission management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Chrome Web Store Integration
- **Publishing**: The extension is now live on the store, allowing for automatic updates and easier installation for non-developers.
- **Badging**: Added a dynamic version/link badge to the README to provide immediate access to the storefront.

### 2. Privacy Education
- **Site Access Guide**: Added a dedicated section in the `README.md` explaining Chrome's "Site Access" controls.
- **On-Click Strategy**: Recommended the "When you click" permission model as the most privacy-respecting way to use the extension, allowing users to opt-in to scanning only when needed.

### 3. Manifest Sanitization
- **Key**: **Important**: The Web Store will sign the extension itself. It will assign the official Extension ID (`mekebojdkoolcckoibjanfhfckknklhm`). Our source code `manifest.json` is kept "keyless" to comply with Store requirements.
- **Local Development**: Note that local "Unpacked" installations will now have a different ID than the Store version. This is the expected and safest development workflow.

## Decision Log
- **Store Compliance**: We prioritized Store compliance over local ID synchronization to eliminate upload errors.
- **Privacy Focus**: Instead of implementing complex "Allow Lists" in the extension UI, we chose to leverage Chrome's robust, native permission system and educate users on its use.
