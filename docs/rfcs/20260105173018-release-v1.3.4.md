# Release v1.3.4 - Chrome Web Store & Privacy

## Summary
Release v1.3.4 marks the official publication of the Wikilink Helper to the Chrome Web Store. It focuses on making the extension more accessible and providing clear guidance on user privacy and permission management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Chrome Web Store Integration
- **Publishing**: The extension is now live on the store, allowing for automatic updates and easier installation for non-developers.
- **Badging**: Added a dynamic version/link badge to the README to provide immediate access to the storefront.

### 2. Privacy Education
- **Site Access Guide**: Added a dedicated section in the `README.md` explaining Chrome's "Site Access" controls.
- **On-Click Strategy**: Recommended the "When you click" permission model as the most privacy-respecting way to use the extension, allowing users to opt-in to scanning only when needed.

## Decision Log
- **Store vs. Sideload**: The Chrome Web Store is now the primary recommended installation path to ensure users receive security updates and benefit from Google's vetting process.
- **Privacy Focus**: Instead of implementing complex "Allow Lists" in the extension UI, we chose to leverage Chrome's robust, native permission system and educate users on its use.
