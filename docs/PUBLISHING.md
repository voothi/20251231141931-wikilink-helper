# How to Publish to the Chrome Web Store

Currently, this extension exists only on your computer. To download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/), you must first **publish** it.

## 1. Prepare for Publishing
The Chrome Web Store accepts a **ZIP file** of your source code, not the `.crx` file we built locally. 
> **Important**: The Web Store will sign the extension itself. It will assign a **new Extension ID**, different from the one generated by our local `key.pem`.

1. Run the build script to ensure `dist/` is fresh.
2. Locate `wikilink-helper.zip` in the `dist/` folder. (Our build script generates this alongside the CRX).

## 2. Register as a Developer
1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/dev/dashboard).
2. Sign in with your Google Account.
3. Pay the **one-time registration fee** ($5 USD).

## 3. Upload Your Item
1. Click **+ New Item**.
2. Click **Browse files** and select `dist/wikilink-helper-1.3.2.zip`.
3. The dashboard will analyze your manifest and upload the code.

## 4. Store Listing
You will need to provide:
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the extension does.
- **Icon**: Your 128x128 icon (already in `assets/`).
- **Screenshots**: At least one screenshot of the extension in action (1280x800 or 640x400).
- **Category**: e.g., "Productivity" or "Search tools".
- **Language**: English.

## 5. Submit for Review
1. Once all details are filled, click **Submit for review**.
2. Google’s team will review the code and listing (usually takes 1-3 days).
3. Once approved, your extension will be live, and you will get a permanent link (e.g., `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wikilink-helper/...`).

## Note on "Key" and "IDs"
- The **Private Key (`key.pem`)** we generated is for **local** use only (Enterprise policy or manual CRX install).
- The **Chrome Web Store** manages its own keys. The Store version will have a **different ID** than your local version. You cannot "upload" your `key.pem` to the Store.
