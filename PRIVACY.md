# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: 2025-12-31

## 1. Data Collection
The "Wikilink Helper" extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data, browsing history, or user information to external servers.

## 2. Data Usage
- **Local Settings**: User preferences (Link Format, Copy Mode, Click Action) are stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **Web Content Access**: The extension accesses the text content of web pages you visit (specifically `github.com` and `gist.github.com`) solely for the purpose of identifying and formatting wikilinks (`[[...]]`). This processing happens entirely within your browser.
- **Clipboard**: The extension writes to your clipboard (`clipboardWrite` permission) only when you explicitly click a wikilink or invoke a copy action.

## 3. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## 4. Contact
For questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
